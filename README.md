# Kids Personal Robot (KiPerBot)



## General Ideia

Build a cluster of rasperry-pi to build a kids personal robot 

## Modes

The robot will stay close to the children all the time. Therefore, I tought on many different execution modes:
- auto recharge
- children follow mode
- voice recognition
- voice programming (this is new.. i need to think about it)
- play games 
- tv remote control 

## Modules

We will use ROS (robot operating system) on top of the modules and it will have to following modes:

- vision (slam, object recognition, etc)
- voice (voice recognition, intent classification, etc)
- movement control (interpret high level commands: ''follow me'', grab my keys, etc)
- brain (coordinate all modules and also be responsible to change the other modules)

## Hardware list

- raspberry pi (at least three)
- stereo camera (two webcams), neck moviment
- arm (need to think about it)
- small robot chassis (10 km/h and off-road, can be a 3d printed, omni wheel)
- distance sensors or a 360 sonar
- speakers
- microphone (two of them to work as a human ear)
- touch screen (simulate the face)
- lipo batteries (more than 20 hours)
